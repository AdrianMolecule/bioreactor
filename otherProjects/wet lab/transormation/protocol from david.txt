you calculate upon the known transformation efficiency from a plasmid and the colony forming units of that plasmid in different selection markers, in this case all the plasmids I transformed are the pDawn with different content (taq, pfu, rt) all in LB-Kan
6:37
plus controls
6:37
all treated with the same procedure:


grow your cells (BL21 DE3) to approx. 0.5 OD or just a 1/20 of the initial overnight inoculum, leave it for 3-4 hrs, (10ml culture vol)
after that you spin down and wash with simple cold deionized, autoclaved water
twice

water from the fridge (4-8°C)

then  make aliquots of 1ml and then split it 100uL in independent tubes

you can keep them in the fridge over night or

add appro 10ng of plasmids per tube, then move them to the freezer for no more than 5 min

adjust your microwave to 300w and give them a pulse for 30sec

add 1m fresh, new sterile LB

incubate at 37°C for 45 min to 1hr

plate on agarLB+ antibiotics

incubate a 37°C or desired temp (pDawn grows better around 25°C)

and voilá!

that sounds pretty simple and straightforward. So you mean you count the colonies from the transformed bacteria that fluoresce versus bacteria that does not fluoresce on the same plate?

David J.Castillo  6:56 PM
in this case they are not fluorescent but I can try like that, in this case are those that acquire the resistance with the transformed plasmid

Adrian Molecule  6:57 PM
or 2 plates - one negative untransformed plate  versus a trnasformed one?

David J.Castillo  6:57 PM
the plain BL21 DE3 dies in the presence of Kan
6:57
yeah
6:57
exactly

Adrian Molecule  6:59 PM
so 2 plates: one with Kan and transformed bacteria. One with no Kan and BL21 DE3. The transformed plate will have much less colonies (edited) 

David J.Castillo  7:02 PM
Plate 1: LB-Kan plus BL21-DE3 and the kan resistant plasmid = Colonies; Plate 2 LB-Kan plus BL21-DE3, with NO plasmid, they die; Plate 3 LB- plus BL21-DE3 with no plasmid= lots of colonies
7:03
I will patch the colonies on a new fresh LB-Kan and run some mini preps to confirm.

Adrian Molecule  7:14 PM
so the difference between Plate 1 and 3 will tell you how many of the plasmids made it in the bacteria. Normally is 1 in 10 000 -20000

David J.Castillo  7:14 PM
yup

Adrian Molecule  7:15 PM
and you tied this protocol with 3 types of plasmids and obtained a high transformation rate
7:16
it's fast and does not require CaCL2 reagents

David J.Castillo  7:16 PM
yup
7:17
faster, cheaper

Adrian Molecule  7:17 PM
the trick is to note the numbers because the microwave seconds depend on the quantity of liquid

David J.Castillo  7:19 PM
100uL per tube
7:20
more or less

Adrian Molecule  7:20 PM
I would probably do something like this. Take a 100 ml flask with 50 ml water and microwave for 30 seconds.
7:20
measure the temperatre

David J.Castillo  7:20 PM
in my case the microwave i got the manual tells how you can calculate the power

Adrian Molecule  7:21 PM
then adjust the time for any other microwave to heat the same quantity of liquid at the same temperature
7:21
it's not the power but the heat that the best way to calculate

David J.Castillo  7:21 PM
the critical part is maintaining the same power
7:22
ok
7:22
yeah the resulting heat
7:22
I read a note on epicurious about that hold on

Adrian Molecule  7:22 PM
with the same power you'll get dierent results for microwaes of dierent olumes
