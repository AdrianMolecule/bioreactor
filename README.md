For the code we could look at the code for https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGaudiLabs%2FPocketPCR%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0emt1N3A4RLu8EtT7nq5stw3ts_awHCC2e0JWRhaY3oLNG6bl1UBnMZng&h=AT3UDoYen690jPD6kb-bAwbC56o7ISySCo3P8hsIEpD-KXIHWzRbC0Dn7QaA98h1bm16VFPRpT7GBglTOVPUzHuE25uVBkpfA_UjMN10c4-wZOauuWwJ8cetMEdilWAh-t0rYWWFlet-8YittmB_YA

that is coding for a PCR machine but basically is the same where we create a program and start it. PCR controls just temperature abut we control also PH and shake and measure OD but is all the same.
Also Bioeconomy project has a google drive we have access to
drive folder with last bioreactor prototype https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14YpeShKaH3NqfBJduj5NzSwRn3Fuwif3?usp=sharing
and they have code.
